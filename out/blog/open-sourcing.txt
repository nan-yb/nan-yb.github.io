It was so simple and to my surprise, it became a hit instantly."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Eventually I extracted part of it to become universal-cookie, which was a more generic JavaScript library.

I always tell new developers that coding is only half the job. If you are open sourcing your own library, you will have to manage feature requests, bug issues, pull requests and setup CI/CD. You will have to manage releases and make sure you do not break everyone’s code. You can become the reason a lot of developers are grumpy and ruin their day. You don’t want to be that person. Open source will allow you to spend more time learning those skills while you might not be in charge of that at work."}]}]]}],["$","h2",null,{"id":"will-this-burn-me-out","children":[["$","a",null,{"href":"#will-this-burn-me-out","aria-hidden":"true","tabIndex":"-1","children":["$","span",null,{"className":"icon icon-link"}]}],"Will This Burn Me Out?"]}],["$","p",null,{"children":"This might seem like a lot because it is!

It can become very unhealthy to spend all your free time on open source projects while also working a full time job. You need the disconnect to stay mentally sharp.

Well it wasn’t intended to be that long but I was already busy being burned out by building a startup and having a newborn instead 😅."}],["$","p",null,{"children":"Like one of my colleagues used to remind me: “Life is a marathon, not a sprint”.
