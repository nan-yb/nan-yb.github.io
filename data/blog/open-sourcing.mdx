title: 'Open Sourcing Libraries Made Me A Better Developer'

summary: I was lucky enough to make my first open source contribution at my job early on. While I was working on a R&D project to convert a video game engine from C++ to WebGL in 2011, I was using an open source tool to automate that process. I was building a prototype and hit a bug. By looking at the source code, I was able to pinpoint the issue, opened a pull request and it was swiftly merged into the library.

I was lucky enough to make my first open source contribution at my job early on. While I was working on a R&D project to convert a video game engine from C++ to WebGL in 2011, I was using an open source tool to automate that process. I was building a prototype and hit a bug. By looking at the source code, I was able to pinpoint the issue, opened a pull request and it was swiftly merged into the library.

Unfortunately my project got tanked because WebGL support on mobile was nonexistent at that time. Nonetheless, that little introduction to the open source world gave me motivation to keep working on projects in my free time. When I was building my pet projects, I was always looking for useful reusable code that lacked support in the community.

The first couple of libraries that I started from scratch were integration between ReactJS libraries and Meteor. Because I was an early adopter of both, I immediately spotted missing integrations with popular libraries, built them and published them. I was really proud because they became really popular fast, thanks to those libraries that were already known.

## My &ldquo;Random&rdquo; Success
This is when something crazy happened. While working on pet projects, I realized that nothing was really existing in ReactJS to manage cookies. I mean people were using the native API, but it wasn‚Äôt nicely integrated into the framework. I spent a day building what is known by the community as react-cookie. Its first version was the dumbest thing I ever had to code. It was so simple and to my surprise, it became a hit instantly.

Eventually I extracted part of it to become universal-cookie, which was a more generic JavaScript library. It became an even bigger success because now, you can use it with a lot more frameworks. It became my first library to hit over 1 million weekly downloads. They now have around 1.7 million weekly downloads combined.

I am not telling you all of this to brag. I am telling you because I am not a special person and if I can do it, you can do it as well! This is my plea to convince you to give it a shot. You might be asking ‚ÄúAnd why should I give up my time for free like that? I have more fun things to do and maybe a family to take care of.‚Äù Maybe you are at a place in your career where this is no longer necessary and that‚Äôs fine. 

## The 3 Main Benefits of Open Sourcing

Open sourcing libraries give you three very important benefits.

1. It allows you to learn a lot. By working on open source projects, you will touch technologies, tools and code that you would never have the opportunity to work with. This will give you more knowledge but more importantly better perspective when taking decisions, even if they are on completely unrelated technologies.

2. It gives you a lot of credibility in the job market. You are no longer just a developer, you are also a library author. People will see you as an expert, even if you are not. Silly? I know! But it can help you land your dream job someday. I got a job interview at Google because they saw one of my open source contributions.

3. And last but not least, it will make you grow as a developer outside of the code. I always tell new developers that coding is only half the job. If you are open sourcing your own library, you will have to manage feature requests, bug issues, pull requests and setup CI/CD. You will have to manage releases and make sure you do not break everyone‚Äôs code. You can become the reason a lot of developers are grumpy and ruin their day. You don‚Äôt want to be that person. Open source will allow you to spend more time learning those skills while you might not be in charge of that at work.

## Will This Burn Me Out?

This might seem like a lot because it is! Most open source libraries have a single major contributor while in a decent sized company, this work is splitted among many teams. This will give you the opportunity to better understand the whole software development life cycle that you never had the opportunity to explore before.

This is also why so many developers suffer from burnout. It can become very unhealthy to spend all your free time on open source projects while also working a full time job. You need the disconnect to stay mentally sharp. This is why I had to take a 4 year break from doing any meaningful contribution. Well it wasn‚Äôt intended to be that long but I was already busy being burned out by building a startup and having a newborn instead üòÖ.

Like one of my colleagues used to remind me: ‚ÄúLife is a marathon, not a sprint‚Äù. You can find a good balance that works for you as long as you are being careful.

Good news is you don‚Äôt have to go the hard way. You can simply start contributing to existing open source projects. Almost all of them are desperate for help and you don‚Äôt have the pressure of responding to requests. 

**Any help is good help for them so go look for something to contribute!**
